        What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
        and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
        not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
        the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.

      <h2> Why do we use it? </h2>
      <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
        look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
        page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
        search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
        infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
